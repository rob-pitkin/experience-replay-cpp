# Project Approach
- Do not write any code without being explicitly asked to do so.
- Instead, for all changes, I want to **learn by doing**.
- This means doing things like:
  - Add `TODO` comments to the code to instruct me what to do without giving me the solution.
  - Write instruction steps for me to follow to complete the task.

# Docs
- Always refer back to `docs/replay_buffer_spec.md` for the project specification.
- Update `docs/timeline.md` to reflect the current progress of the project and what the current tasks are.
- Take any notes that you would like to remember for future reference or just to use as a memory doc in `docs/notes.md`.
